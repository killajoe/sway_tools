# flameshot_on_sway:
As of i do really need something like flamshot to do screenshots,

add markings and hints or blur parts e.t.c

And no it is not working on sway!


So I wrote a stupid little script that saves a rectangular selection as a screenshot 

with grim and slurp and then opens it in swappy so that you can add your markers, 

the edited screenshot is then saved in the screenshot directory ($HOME/Pictures/screenshots)

# How it works

Setting up keybinds in Sway

If you use Swayâ€™s config (usually $HOME/.config/sway/config), you can bind keys to run the script:

``` 
# take a screenshot of a selection:
bindsym $mod+Print exec  --no-startup-id ~/.config/sway/scripts/screenshot-select
# Shot of all screens in one pic after releasing print button:
bindsym --release Print exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/sway/scripts/screenshot
```
