# waybar_toggle - kills all waybar instances and restarting them

Reads all matching `*jsonc` and `*css` files from `$HOME/.config/waybar/` and use these to resload/restart waybar.

First use killing all waybars and second will restart them.

So you can toggle them off if you want them to be off or reload in case of config change.
